## Introduction
This is a document manger.(Not be done yet) You can scan your documents on paper or import your document as images. And have some simple edit for your documents. Then they will be save to your disk by a *Tree structure*. You can also add some tags to your document(s) and they will be saved in a database (I am using SQLite now, and soon I will add support with SQL Server and My SQL). And then you can search documents by tags!
Now this project is not done. If you have some idea or you want to help us (me), you can submit an Issues or fork this repo..
My task list and plan will be sent to *Project*.

This is a document manger.(Not be done yet) You can scan your document on parper or import your document as Image. And have some aimple edit for your document. Then they will be save to your disk by a *Tree structure*. You can also add some tags to your document and they will be saved in database (I am using SQLite now, and soon I will add support with SQL Server and My SQL). And you can search documents by tags!
Now this project is not done. If you have some idea or you want to help us (me), you can submit an Issues or fork this repo.
My task list and plan will be sent to *Project*.
